Track the International Space Station live!

This is a one-page Javascript app showing the live position, orbital parameters and crew information for the ISS.

I used Leaflet.js maps (with a cool day/night overlay from @joergdietrich) and called the "Where the ISS at?" REST API to retrieve the orbital data of the station.

The crew information is hard-coded but I'd like to create an API in the future that provides lots of relevant crew information too.
